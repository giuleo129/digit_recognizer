DigitRecognizer 🎯

This repository contains everything needed to train a neural network for handwritten digit recognition, make predictions, and provide a desktop app to test the model with input images.

📁 Repository Structure:
training/ 🏋️‍♂️ → Scripts for training the neural network using PyTorch.

predictions/ 🔍 → Code for loading the trained model and making predictions.

app/ 🖥️ → Desktop application using Tkinter, allowing users to drag and drop an image to recognize the digit.

weights/ 🏗️ → Model weights (weight_gl.pth) saved after training.

💡 Goal: Develop a CNN-based digit recognition model and integrate it into a user-friendly app! 🚀


!!!WORK IN PROGRESS!!!
